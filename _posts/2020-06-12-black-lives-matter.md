Can I point something out about language?

A few folks I work with responded to the statement that black lives matter with the words "all lives matter." Knowing these folks, I think they believe that statement is innocuous.

I want to dispel that idea.

Responding to the assertion that black lives matter with the words "all lives matter" is cruel. It is cruel because of how that statement is being used. Words never operate solely on the literal level--people feel the need to say things because they want to see change in the world. Saying something is an action with the intent to cause or prevent change.

Take a simple example: imagine that you are sitting and watching television when I come up in front of you and block the T.V. You would probably respond by saying "you're in front of the T.V." That statement is not an observation--you are not saying "I observe that you are currently standing in front of the television set." You are asserting a wish--you want me to move so you can keep watching T.V. Thus a simple statement that looks on the surface as a literal observation actually operates as a demand for change. You are asserting that I move so you can continue living your life.[^1]

When I say that black lives matter, I am asserting a change in perception and operation in this country. I'm saying that the lives of persons of color are valuable, and therefore serious reform must be made. I am saying that the systems that cause men to be killed over $20 are deplorable and unacceptable, because the lives of black persons matter.

Responding with "all lives matter" is another action. That statement is asserting that the status quo should continue. That statement in this context is a means of stopping thought and conversation about reform that will benefit long ignored and marginalized persons. It is a statement intended to dismiss the fact that the laws and institutions of this nation have wrecked havoc on persons of color long before its inception, all the way to the present day. If you are unaware of the situation and how systemic racism has impacted persons of color for centuries, "all lives matter" seems benign. If you understand the context of the situation, you would clearly understand how such a statement does not intend to improve the lives of disadvantaged persons, but instead ensure that white supremacy continues to reign.

If you honestly believe in the literal interpreation of "all lives matter," then you would not respond with that statement when I say black lives matter. You would respond by saying "yes, black lives do matter, let's collaborate to build a more perfect nation."

[^1]: We have words to describe these acts: saying something is the [locutionary act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locutionary_act), how it is intended to operate is the [illocutionary act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illocutionary_act), and what actually occurs is the [perlocutionary act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlocutionary_act).
