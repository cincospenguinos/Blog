A little while ago my coworkers and I had a brief discussion about the [indie game "Moonlighter"](https://moonlighterthegame.com/), an indie game that captures the experience of working your day job while you get your side hustle up and running to the point that you can do that full-time. I've seen it get a [number of positive reviews on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/606150/Moonlighter/#app_reviews_hash) and a couple of my coworkers expressed their enjoyment of the game. Given that its combat is inspired by the Souls series, and its pixel-art aesthetic is rich and beautiful, I figured that it would be right up my alley.

I'm afraid I was wrong--it's not what I look for in an indie game. I have plenty of good things to say about it, but the game doesn't match my tastes quite as closely as I would have loved, to the point that I'm left wanting.

## Wait, what's this game?

Moonlighter is a 2D indie rogue-lite about a young merchant who wants to explore the dungeon outside of his town. At the beginning of the game your protagonist attempts to explore the dungeon armed with nothing but a broom. He quickly discovers that he'll need a whole lot more than that to make it through, and is encouraged by a local member of the town to sell stuff in his family's shop to make ends meet. The townsperson shows you the ropes to selling goods, and then the player is left to explore the dungeon, loot goods found there, and sell them again to their heart's content.

There's a number of ways to improve your chances while exploring the randomly generated dungeons. You can hire people to come to your town and run different shops. You can purchase gear from these shops that will help you in the dungeons, either by healing you via potions or protecting you with armor or with better weapons. You can upgrade your shop to be able to sell more things or make more money (or both.)

Given the sprite work and the promise of souls-inspired combat, I was willing to pick it up and give it a shot. I loved the hell out of Dark Souls 3, and I've been looking for a quality experience within that vein since I've beaten it.

## Did I tell you why I love Dark Souls 3?

What makes the Dark Souls series (and most especially Dark Souls 3) so engaging to me is that, under the hood, each of the souls games are fighting games. The combat system has a lot of latitude and options for players--a large play-space, if you will--that allows players to select one of a number of viable options of combat, and then compete with one another and the enemies in the environment. There's a light attack and a heavy attack, each with a specific animation length and a large (or small) hit box, and each do corresponding amounts of damage. The length, size, and amount of all of three depend on your weapon, your level in that weapon's attribute (or attributes,) and your modifications to that weapon, as well as your opponent's defenses and resistances. Coming into a fight, you have to pay attention to how your opponent plays--what weapons he uses, what armor he's wearing, whether or not he has a shield, whether your opponent is dodging or hoping to parry, how much reach his weapon has and how much yours has--and then you have to make quick decisions on how you're going to respond.

I have a coworker who gave a stellar talk at a company conference in which he compared jazz musicianship (particularly dueling pianos) to fighting games. He pointed out how both of them require the performer to make serious decisions and take real risks that have enormous impact on their position and the outcome of the competition. To be good at either, one must acquire a great amount of technical skill from hours of study and practice, as well as have the intuition to understand and respond intelligently to their opponent's actions. As both a neophyte fighting game enthusiast and an ex-jazz musician, I can attest to the creative ability and technical skill required to do well at either.

Dark Souls 3 requires study, practice, and intuition to be competitive, particularly in a PvP environment. You have to do some amount of study and practice to learn what works best for you. Are you more comfortable with sorceries, miracles, or pyromancies, or do you want to forgo magic entirely? Is a DEX focused weapon your choice, and if so, is it a daggar? A short-sword? A modified greatsword? How do shields play in your approach to things? What sort of spacing mechanics do you use--arrows/bolts? Fire bombs and lightning urns? Do you want to focus on a certain damage type, ensuring a greater damage against certain opponents over others? How will you compensate for their resistances? Each player makes a number of these decisions over time, building their character up into the specialized fighter that can go toe-to-toe in the arena in a way unique to the player.

Add on top of that the fact that the Dark Souls games are deep and gnarled and beautiful, both in story-telling and in world-building, and you're left with an experience that is unparalleled. The richness of the cryptic and horrifying setting coupled with the difficult but fair fighting system underneath it all makes a brilliant game that admittedly scores low in accessibility, but yields nothing but high marks on everything I value.

## So, Anyway, Moonlighter...

Moonlighter's souls influence is immediately recognizable in its combat. You have a light attack and a heavy attack, a shield, and a dodge-roll. Dodge-rolling allows you to negate all damage, but it's risky and difficult to use. A shield can block a decent amount of damage, but you'll always take a bit. On the surface, it seems fine. Like most things, however, the devil is in the details.

### Only four directions!?

Your character is only able to attack either horizontally or vertically. If you're hoping to aim in any other direction, you're out of luck. If you're hoping to dodge-roll in another direction, too bad. If you're hoping to do virtually anything other than move in another direction, guess what: you can't. Too damn bad for you.

I imagine that this was a technical limitation. Those beautiful sprites ain't cheap, and in game dev, you don't have time to repeat work over and over. Since the team was committed to the top-down view, it's likely that including a varied attack set simply wasn't available to them in the time available.

That doesn't mean a solution doesn't exist. We've seen this done well in games like [Enter the Gungeon](https://www.enterthegungeon.com/), wherein the player's sprite only looks forward or backward, but the hand holding the gun operates as a separate sprite that points at where the player is aiming. I would have loved to see something to this effect in Moonlighter as well, as that would allow the combat to be more nuanced and more interesting than what it has.

### Oh yeah, the leveling system...

It doesn't exist. You sell the goods you get in the dungeons to make money. You spend the money to get better equipment and supplies. You use equipment and supplies to get more things to make more money to get more supplies to get more things until you've bought everything and you've beaten all five of the dungeons (plus whatever DLC they throw at you.) There is no "leveling system" in the traditional RPG sense--you don't have a level, you don't have attributes to improve in any way, nor do you gain experience points by defeating enemies. Progress comes only by making money.

This in and of itself isn't a bad thing, but compared to Dark Souls 3, it's limited. There was a huge amount of customization available to the player in Dark Souls 3, and part of the fun was discovering how all of the pieces fit together and how I could take advantage of them to create a potent fighter in PvE and PvP. Such customization isn't available in this game, and given the limitations of combat movement already in place, a lack of options outside of "buy better stuff" left a poor taste in my mouth.

I wish the design team had more time to explore expanding on the experience of progress here. Progress can happen by moving up to tougher dungeons, but that's dependent only on whether or not you have the best stuff. Having it be dependent on your mastery of a separate leveling system would have provided the depth I could sink my teeth into.

### What about the world?

The broad strokes of an interesting story is are there--you're a merchant, but you have longed to explore the dangerous dungeon outside of town your whole life. Finally you're in a place to do both, and the game is you doing that. Once again though, Moonlighter falls apart in the details--this time because there are none.

I can't tell you much about any of the world or characters because they all come across as cardboard standees. I don't know the protagonist's name (and no, I don't see how that is being used for artistic intent here.) I don't know the name of the town, and in spite of the fact that this crazy constantly shifting dungeon is right outside of the town, not much happens in the town concerning the dungeon. None of the other townsfolk seem to care much about it, with the exception of one or two who say "hey man don't go there it's dangerous."

Everything feels like a backdrop for making money and dungeoneering, but given how limited all of that is in a game-sense, the lack of detail in the story and world glares the player right in the face. Expanding on who I am, why I should give a damn about this town, what this crazy dungeon's relationship to the rest of the town is, and how my actions impact the situation could pan out to be a fascinating thing to explore, but sadly such a thing is not there.

This is where Dark Souls shines. Virtually everything in the world has a huge amount of lore behind it. There is a strong attention to detail throughout the entire series that makes each environment, each space feel unique and different, but related to one another through a larger narrative. The narrative focus on the cyclical nature of history--empires and kingdoms of light and dark that rise and fall--is told in cryptic notes on items, a few conversations with NPCs, and a smattering of cutscenes at the beginning and end of the game.

This is also where Moonlighter could have borrowed some ideas from Enter the Gungeon. There are NPCs you meet in each of the dungeons, and they impact the player's ability to progress directly, either by selling goods in the hub area or by providing other abilities in the dungeon itself. Your actions with each of these NPCs does impact the world in some way--they appear to help you out, to sell you things, or otherwise provide information while you're maneuvering through the world.

There's a plethora of ways to tell an engaging story within the limits of a videogame. Moonlighter could have explored some of those ways in order to compensate for its weaker combat system.

### Did I mention dungeon design?

Designing a rogue-lite dungeon generator can be difficult. You have to provide enough variation to make the game endlessly playable, while also providing enough similarity to ensure various areas are still completeable at the skill level the designers desire. This means that you need to make some variables be totally dependent on the randomized system, while others need to be strictly limited. Few games do this well--[Rogue Legacy](http://cellardoorgames.com/roguelegacy/) and [Spelunky](https://spelunkyworld.com/) are prime examples of that for me.

Moonlighter made every room fit the exact same set of dimensions, and then each room would randomly select one of a small number of variations, with the enemies sitting in the same places and the same traps in the same spots over, and over, and over. Because of how restricted the layout of a dungeon is, beating the first dungeon was seeing virtually every possible pattern in the subsequent dungeons. I never came across a variation that was unbeatable due to level orientation, but doing so would have been much more engaging than seeing the same patterns over and over again.

Allowing for different-sized rooms and tinkering with room layouts would have helped prevent making the dungeons feel too similar to one-another.

### I can say nice things too!

I liked a number of things in the game. The process of discovering the best price for your goods is fun and engaging. Not only do you need to find the ideal price for an item, but you also need to navigate fluctuations in the market. You can sell a huge number of a rare item for a high price, but it may be detrimental if it impacts the market--[the law of supply and demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand) is still at play.

The game is beautiful to look at. I love the colors, the animations, the way each of the items and characters are rendered and performed. I love how bright and interesting each of the parts of the world feels. I love how the town looks, and I love how my house and shop looks at each step of progress. All-in-all, the art direction of the game grabs me and keeps me engaged in just the right way.

I liked how they did inventory management--each expedition into the dungeons is a puzzle, figuring out what items I'm going to keep and what I need to let go of, as well as remaining conscious of how I put them in my bag. I like how to make more money you need to dungeoneer more, and to dungeoneer better you need to sell good money.

I like how the separate systems interact--you dungeoneer to make money to buy better gear to make better money. Fluctuations in the market can happen if you dungeoneer in a place too often and sell too much of a thing, while listening to the market allows you to decide on what things you want to grab to make better money.

All of those things are strengths of the game that I will sing praises to, but sadly, those pieces aren't enough for me to stick with the game.

## The Verdict

I cannot, in good conscience, recommend the game wholeheartedly. It's certainly an interesting game--partially because of the experience it's delivering on, but partially because it's a game whose systems are extremely visible to the player. If you're looking for a rogue-lite with some interesting (albeit simplified) economics systems and you're willing to overlook the weak story, atmosphere, and limited combat system, I'd say give it a shot. But if your taste is anything like mine, you'll probably drop the game before getting terribly far, as the only question that will ring through your mind will be "why should I care?"
