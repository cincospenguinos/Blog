* There's different reasons to write code
* There's different things that need to be explored, and code can help you with that
* My previous comment smashing post had a certain perspective
	* It assumed that the code being checked in is for a long-term application
	* But there's other uses--teaching oneself, academic work, etc.
	* Comments are a tool to be used; that tool may be more helpful in one of those other contexts
* All of that said, if you check in commented-out code to my application I will fire you
