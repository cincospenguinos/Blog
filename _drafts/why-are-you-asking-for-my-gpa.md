	<p>Grown-ups like numbers. When you tell them about a new friend, they never ask questions about what really matters. They never ask: ‘What does his voice sound like?’ ‘What games does he like best?’ ‘Does he collect butterflies?’ They ask: ‘How old is he?’ ‘How many brothers does he have?’ ‘How much does he weigh?’ ‘How much money does he have?’ Only then do they think they know him. If you tell grown-ups, ‘I saw a beautiful red brick house, with geraniums at the windows and doves at the roof…,’ they won’t be able to imagine such a house. You have to tell them, ‘I saw a house worth a thousand francs.’ Then they exclaim, ‘What a pretty house!'</p>

I've been looking for a new job recently. I've been looking for fun and interesting places to work, new and interesting problems to solve, and engaged and interesting people to work with. I've been looking at mid-level and senior roles--partially because that's my experience level, but also because I believe that's where my expertise is. I've filled out a lot of job applications, and although generally it's the usual stuff, I've been hit a couple times asking for my GPA. And everytime I get asked about it, in my mind I'm thinking _why on earth is that relevant to my abilities as an employee!? Does a high GPA indicate an understanding of coupling and cohesion? Of the ability to discover and refactor smelly code? Or is it just another number to judge people by?_

## Don't ask me for my GPA

Not because it's low (even though it's certainly not where I would have loved it to have been.) Not even because it isn't totally relevant for a hire fresh out of college (even though I think that point is debatable too.) Don't ask for it because **it's not relevant**. People are dynamic. Their skillsets grow and shift after college. Later job experience better prepares folks for employment, so don't use a number to determine an employee's abilities.
